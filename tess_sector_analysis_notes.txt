Starting April 22... 
- sucessfully untangled EB signal from transit signal using a Savitzky Golay filter, for all 2024 sectors that showed contamination by EB. 
- used a Carter model to fit the transit MIDTIME only for each individual lc of a sector after the EB signal has been removed. 
- all code to do this is in "Conditioning HAT-P-37 Data Final.ipynb" 

Individual Sector notes: 
Sector 26: 
    Thursday April 24
E 1206 - 1212
extra transit from start of sector to first chunking break... change value of `min_elapsed` to include it
remove 1208
removing 1210 and 1207 for now, fit is breaking

Sector 40: 
    Thursday April 24
E 1341-1349 
Note: Epoch 1349 is in this sector AND the observations published in A-thano, results agree.
Throw out E 1345 because 

Sector 41:
    Thursday April 24
E 1351 - 1359
remove E 1355 no transit present

Sector 53: 
    Thursday April 24
E 1469-1474
Detrending seems to be least effective in this sector
transit right at the end of sector, had to adjust `max_elapsed`
remove 1467 & 1468 no transit present

Sector 54:
    Thursday April 24
extra transit from start of sector to first chunking break... change value of `min_elapsed` to include it
remove Epochs 1479 and 1483, chunks do not include transit

Sector 55: 
    Thursday April 24
E 1486-1494
Epoch 1490 - only half transit, breaks code.

Sectors 74:
    Tuesday April 22
This sector is not contaiminated by the EB, running only chunking and fitting code to analyze the midtimes. 
Remember: sectors that are not detrended MUST be normalized before using the Carter Model code
0, 2, 5, 6

Sector 75: 
    Tuesday April 22
0, 1, 6 - No contamination

Sector 80: 
    Thursday April 24
E 1730-1738
If the chunking code has no indices, it doesn't make the chunk.. so this sector already skips the blank spots.. 

Sector 82: 
    Tuesday April 22
E 1749-1757
kick out the first and last chunks because they do not contain a full orbital period
Note: 4/24 update to code drops first and last chunks
