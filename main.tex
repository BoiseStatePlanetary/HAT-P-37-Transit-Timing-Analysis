%% Version 7. Created January 2025.  
%%
%% AASTeX v7 calls the following external packages:
%% times, hyperref, ifthen, hyphens, longtable, xcolor, 
%% bookmarks, array, rotating, ulem, and lineno 
%%
%% RevTeX is no longer used in AASTeX v7.
%%
\documentclass[linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex7}
%%
%% This initial command takes arguments that can be used to easily modify 
%% the output of the compiled manuscript. Any combination of arguments can be 
%% invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[argument1,argument2,argument3,...]{aastex7}
%%
%% Six of the arguments are typestting options. They are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  default     : one text column, 10 point font, single spaced (default).
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default.
%%   linenumbers  : turn on linenumbering. Note this is mandatory for AAS
%%                  Journal submissions and revisions.
%%   trackchanges : Shows added text in bold.
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations, acknowledgments,
%%                  and author contributions for dual anonymous review.
%%  resetfootnote : Reset footnotes to 1 in the body of the manuscript.
%%                  Useful when there are a lot of authors and affiliations
%%		    in the front matter.
%%   longbib      : Print article titles in the references. This option
%% 		    is mandatory for PSJ manuscripts.
%%
%% Since v6, AASTeX has included \hyperref support. While we have built in 
%% specific %% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them 
%% with the \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003
%%
%% The "bookmarks" has been changed to "true" in hyperref
%% to improve the accessibility of the compiled pdf file.
%%
%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.

\title{Searching for Non-Keplerian Orbital Motion in the HAT-P-37 Hot Jupiter System with the Help of Transit Observations by Small Telescopes}

%% Due to the length of the author list, it is corralled into it's own tex file. 
\input{author_list.tex}


%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment. 
\begin{abstract}

HAT-P-37 b is a Hot Jupiter with an approximate 2.8 day period around a 0.9 solar mass G-type star. Recent studies of HAT-P-37 b have shown it exhibits transit timing variations (TTVs) most recently compared to a precession model. In this work, we present a total of X new midtimes for HAT-P-37 b. These results are a combination of transit observations from TESS, the on-campus observatory at Boise State University, \COM{ASU transits,} and from amateur astronomers \COM{only Unistellar?} to increase the observational baseline of HAT-P-37 b in an effort to distinguish the cause of the transit timing variation. \COM{Potentially add the \DeltaBIC ??}

\end{abstract}

%% Keywords should appear after the \end{abstract} command. 
%% The AAS Journals now uses Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) concepts:
%% https://astrothesaurus.org
%% You will be asked to selected these concepts during the submission process
%% but this old "keyword" functionality is maintained in case authors want
%% to include these concepts in their preprints.
%%
%% You can use the \uat command to link your UAT concepts back its source.
\keywords{\uat{Exoplanet dynamics}{490} --- \uat{Exoplanet tides}{497} --- \uat{Transit timing variation method}{1710} --- \uat{Star-planet interactions}{2177} --- \uat{Stellar astronomy}{1583} --- \uat{Solar physics}{1476}}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.
