  abstract = {Abstract                            We perform transit timing variation (TTV) and transmission spectroscopy analyses of the planet HAT-P-37b, which is a hot Jupiter orbiting a G-type star. Nine new transit light curves are obtained and analyzed together with 21 published light curves from the literature. The updated physical parameters of HAT-P-37b are presented. The TTV analyses show a possibility that the system has an additional planet that induced the TTVs amplitude signal of 1.74 {\textpm} 0.17 minutes. If the body is located near the 1:2 mean-motion resonance orbit, the sinusoidal TTV signal could be caused by the gravitational interaction of a sub-Earth-mass planet with mass of 0.06               M               {$\oplus$}               . From the analysis of an upper-mass limit for the second planet, a Saturn-mass planet with orbital period less than 6 days is excluded. The broadband transmission spectra of HAT-P-37b favors a cloudy atmospheric model with an outlier spectrum in the               B               filter.},

  abstract = {Ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs) are likely doomed by tidal forces to undergo orbital decay and eventual disruption by their stars, but the timescale over which this process unfolds is unknown. We present results from a long-term project to monitor UHJ transits. We recovered WASP-12 b's orbital decay rate of ms yr-1, in agreement with prior work. Five other systems initially had promising nonlinear transit ephemerides. However, a closer examination of two---WASP-19 b and CoRoT-2 b, both with prior tentative detections---revealed several independent errors with the literature timing data; after correction, neither planet shows signs of orbital decay. Meanwhile, a potential decreasing period for TrES-1 b, ms yr-1, corresponds to a tidal quality factor and likely does not result from orbital decay if driven by dissipation within the host star. Nominal period increases in two systems, WASP-121 b and WASP-46 b, rest on a small handful of points. Only 1/43 planets (WASP-12 b) in our sample is experiencing detectable orbital decay. For nearly half (20/42), we can rule out as high as observed for WASP-12 b. Thus, while many UHJs could still be experiencing rapid decay that we cannot yet detect, a sizable subpopulation of UHJs are decaying at least an order of magnitude more slowly than WASP-12 b. Our reanalysis of Kepler-1658 b with no new data finds that it remains a promising orbital decay candidate. Finally, we recommend that the scientific community take steps to avoid spurious detections through better management of the multi-decade-spanning data sets needed to search for and study planetary orbital decay.},

Thanks to its large field of view and faint limiting magnitude, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) offers a unique opportunity to detect variable stars in the northern sky. Here, we exploit ZTF Data Release 2 (DR2) to search for and classify variables down to               r               ~{$\sim~$}20.6 mag. We classify 781,602 periodic variables into 11 main types using an improved classification method. Comparison with previously published catalogs shows that 621,702 objects (79.5\%) are newly discovered or newly classified, including {$\sim$}700 Cepheids, {$\sim$}5000 RR Lyrae stars, {$\sim$}15,000               {$\delta$}               Scuti variables, {$\sim$}350,000 eclipsing binaries, {$\sim$}100,000 long-period variables, and about 150,000 rotational variables. The typical misclassification rate and period accuracy are on the order of 2\% and 99\%, respectively. 74\% of our variables are located at Galactic latitudes,                                                                                                  . This large sample of Cepheids, RR Lyrae,               {$\delta$}               Scuti stars, and contact (EW-type) eclipsing binaries is helpful to investigate the Galaxy's disk structure and evolution with an improved completeness, areal coverage, and age resolution. Specifically, the northern warp and the disk's edge at distances of 15--20 kpc are significantly better covered than previously. Among rotational variables, RS Canum Venaticorum and BY Draconis-type variables can be separated easily. Our knowledge of stellar chromospheric activity would benefit greatly from a statistical analysis of these types of variables.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Many hot Jupiters may experience orbital decays, which are manifested as long-term transit-timing variations. We have analyzed 7068 transits from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for a sample of 326 hot Jupiters. These new mid-transit-time data allow us to update ephemerides for these systems. By combining the new TESS transit-timing data with archival data, we searched for possible long-term variations in the orbital period in these hot Jupiters using a linear and a quadratic ephemeris model. We identified 26 candidates that exhibit possible long-term variations of the orbital period, including 18 candidates with decreasing orbital periods and eight candidates with increasing orbital periods. Among them, 12 candidates failed our leave-one-out cross validation test and thus should be considered to be marginal candidates. In addition to tidal interaction, alternative mechanisms such as apsidal precession, the R{\o}mer effect, and the Applegate effect could also contribute to the variations during the observed period. The ephemerides derived in this work are useful for scheduling follow-up observations for these hot Jupiters in the future. The Python code (               PdotQuest               ,               https://github.com/AeoN400/PdotQuest               ) used to generate the ephemerides is made available online.}

  abstract = {We performed follow-up photometric observations on exoplanetary system HAT-P-37 from 2011 February to 2019 September. The nine new transit light curves of the R and V bands are presented in this work. Based on the new light curves and published literature data, the physical and orbital parameters of HAT-P-37 are refined. In addition, mid-transit times are obtained to update the linear ephemeris, Tc[0] = 2456478.57916 {\textpm} 0.00077 [BJDTDB], P = 2.7974415 {\textpm} 0.0000025 d. Moreover, the transit timing variations (TTVs) have an rms of 57 s and there is no significant TTV signal. According to dynamic analysis, we excluded the possibility of perturbers with a mass larger than 200M{$\oplus$}, when located in 1 : 3, 1 : 2, 2 : 3 (interior) or 3 : 2, 2 : 1, 5 : 2, 3 : 1 (exterior) orbital resonance, respectively.},
